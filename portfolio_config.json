  "PORTFOLIO_META_DESCRIPTION": "Daniel's photography portfolio. A visual journey through moody cityscapes, atmospheric landscapes, and dramatic, story-driven moments captured in low light.",
  "PORTFOLIO_ABOUT_HEADING": "Through My Eyes",
  "PORTFOLIO_ABOUT_CONTENT": "<p>While my professional world revolves around structure and logic, photography is my way of exploring without a blueprint. I'm drawn to the moments in between—the quiet street corner after the rain, the stillness of a landscape at dusk, or the way light plays in the shadows.</p><p>This is my outlet for observation, a practice in finding the narrative in everyday scenes. It’s less about technical perfection and more about capturing a feeling. I hope these images invite you to pause, reflect, and see the world from a slightly different perspective.</p>",
